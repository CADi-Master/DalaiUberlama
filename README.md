# Private Repo (One-Upload Pack)

Purpose: **Keep this repo PRIVATE** and give you a clean, working structure without any hidden folders or CI nonsense.

## What's inside
- `README.md` — this file.
- `NO_LICENSE.txt` — repo is private; no open‑source license attached.
- `GITIGNORE` — ignores junk like `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, etc.
- `main.py` — simple starter script.
- `ledger.txt` — plain‑text ledger (not a PDF).
- `requirements.txt` — add deps if you need them.
- `docs/` — drop notes/specs here (kept visible).
- `tests/` — optional; contains a tiny smoke test.
- `images/` — placeholder for assets.

## How to use (3 steps)
1. Create a **new private repo** on GitHub (no init files).
2. In the repo: **Add file → Upload files** → drag **ALL CONTENTS** of this zip (not the zip itself).
3. Commit. Done. (Everything stays private.)

## After upload (optional)
- Edit `ledger.txt` in the browser and commit updates as you go.
- If you want Actions/CI later, tell me and I'll ship a visible-only add‑on pack.
