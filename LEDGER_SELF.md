**Summary**
- What improved:  
- What regressed:  
- Top 3 adjustments for next week:  

---



## Standard Basic Competence — Graphic Design Production

### ✅ Standing Requirements (Basic Competence)
These are the minimum I must enforce on **every technical drawing, schematic, or print-ready page**:

- **Scale Bar** → Always include on schematics/maps for measurable reference.
- **Margins & Bleed** → 0.25" safe zone + 0.125" bleed on KDP/print.
- **Resolution** → 300 DPI minimum for print outputs.
- **Dimensions** → Explicit labels for page size and drawing dimensions.
- **Titles/Labels** → Every figure/page must have a title; schematics need view labels (Front/Side/Top/etc.).
- **Proof Artifact** → At least one PDF or PNG output that can be opened directly.
- **QR Code (when relevant)** → On covers, schematics, branding sheets, linking to repo/docs/source of truth.

**Audit Rule:**
- If any required element is missing, mark ❌ in the daily audit under **Artifacts** and regenerate until corrected.

---

### ⭐ Nice-to-Have Extras (Optional Enhancements)
These add polish, but aren’t mandatory every time:

- **Exploded Views** → For schematics, optional if component detail matters.
- **Color Coding** → Helpful in diagrams/infographics, but not required for B/W technical line art.
- **Grid/Guides Visible** → Sometimes useful for clarity, but usually hidden in final output.
- **Watermark / Version Tag** → Optional; useful in drafts or collab workflows, not in final print.
- **Multiple Layout Variants** → Side-by-side style options (minimal vs ornate) if exploring design directions.
- **Metadata Embeds** → Adding creator, repo link, or date inside file properties; useful, but not a must.
