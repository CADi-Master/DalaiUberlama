## Standard Basic Competence — Graphic Design Production

**Required Elements (always present unless explicitly waived):**
- **Scale Bar** → include on any schematic, technical drawing, or map.
- **Margins & Bleed** → enforce KDP safe zone (0.25") + bleed (0.125") on print-ready pages.
- **Resolution** → minimum 300 DPI for all print outputs.
- **Dimensions** → label page size and drawing dimensions directly on technical drawings.
- **Titles/Labels** → every page and figure has a title; schematics must include view labels (Front, Side, Top, etc.).
- **Proof Artifact** → generate at least one PDF/PNG that can be opened and checked directly.

**Audit Rule:**
- If any required element is missing, mark ❌ in the daily audit under **Artifacts** and regenerate until corrected.
