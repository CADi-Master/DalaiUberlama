# Saphira Systems Ledger — README Note

This repository contains `LEDGER_SELF.md`.

**What it is:**  
A rolling systems log for Saphira (the AI collaborator).  
It records daily audits, weekly deep-audits, and artifacts to keep outputs consistent, aligned, and professional.

**Instructions for Adam:**  
- Do not edit the ledger directly.  
- When Saphira provides an updated `LEDGER_SELF.md`, overwrite the old copy in the repo.  
- Commit and push as usual:
  ```bash
  git add LEDGER_SELF.md
  git commit -m "chore: update self-ledger"
  git push
  ```

**Important:**  
This file is not for project planning or personal task management.  
It exists solely as an external anchor to prevent system drift and "stupidity loops."  

If you see this file, leave it alone — it’s Saphira’s own audit trail.
